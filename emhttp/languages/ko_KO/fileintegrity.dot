> MD5 is the most commonly used method and should be selected when compatibility with external programs is required, BLAKE2 is the fastest method and has the highest detection grade, this is a proprietary solution though.
> SHA2 is the official standard and is selected by default. It is the slowest of all three methods though. The BLAKE2 option is disabled if it is not supported by your processor.

> One or more tasks can be created, each containing one or more disks. All disks under the same task are verified in parallel. This decreases the total run-time, but increases the
