The **Parity Problems Assistant** is part of the **Parity Check Tuning** plugin.<p/>
The current status is **EXPERIMENTAL** and it is always possible that this assistant may be removed in the future).  
**(feedback is welcomed on the basic concept and ideas for improvement)**.<p/>
The idea is that this assistant can be used after a parity check or read check has reported problems and logged the details of any problem sectors to the syslog.  
In many cases such errors can be due to external factors such as cabling or the power supply rather than the actual disks.<p/>
It is also not uncommon, particularly on **Ryzen/ThreadRipper** based systems, to get random parity errors if the RAM is overclocked
(an XMP profile **is** an overclock),  
and the motherboard/CPU combination may also impose limits that are lower than the RAM is capable of supporting.<p/>
If you think you have rectified whatever caused the problems to occur then you can use this assistant to run a partial check over a narrow range to see if the problem still occurs.  
This can be much faster than having to run a full parity check or read check to see if you have resolved the issue or to run a disk extended SMART test to test the actual disk.<p/>
**IMPORTANT**:  This assistant should never be used as an alternative to running a full parity check once you think the problem has been resolved.
