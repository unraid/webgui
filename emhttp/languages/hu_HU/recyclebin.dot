> Set to **Yes** to enable the Recycle Bin deleted file functionality on Unassigned Devices drive shares when the Unassigned Devices plugin is installed.  SMB/NFS mounts and iso mounts are excluded from the Recycle Bin functionality on this server.  Enable the Recycle Bin on the remote server where the remote share originates if it is an Unraid server.

> + '%S' Samba share name (which in Unraid equals the share name), eg. Storage
> + '%P' User share full path, eg /mnt/user/Storage, /mnt/disk1, /mnt/disks/unassigned_device, /flash
