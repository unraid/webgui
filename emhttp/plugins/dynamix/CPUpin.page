> This page gives a total view of the current CPU pinning assignments for Docker containers.<br>
> It also allows to modify these assignments.
> 
> Running containers are **stopped first** and restarted after the modification.<br>
> Stopped containers are instantly modified and new assignments become active when the user manually starts the container.
> 
> When ***Apply*** is pressed a scan is performed to find the changes, subsequently containers which have changes are modified in parallel.
> 
> *Important: Please wait until all updates are finished before leaving this page*.
> 
> By default NO cores are selected for a Docker container, which means it uses all available cores.<br>
> Do not select **ALL** cores for containers, just select **NO** cores if you want unrestricted core use.
> 
> Do not select cores for containers which are *isolated*.
> By design a container will only use a single core (the lowest numbered core) when multiple isolated cores are selected.<br>
> Usually this is not what a user wants when selecting multiple cores.
